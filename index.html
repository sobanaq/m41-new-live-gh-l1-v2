    <h1> BEE GEES</h1>
    <h2>Staying alive</h2>
    <p1> Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
        I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
        Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around
        Since I was born
        And now it's alright, it's okay
        And you may look the other way
        We can try to understand
        The New York Times' effect on man</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p2> Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
        You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
        Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
        And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
        Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
        Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
        Oh, when you walk</p2>
